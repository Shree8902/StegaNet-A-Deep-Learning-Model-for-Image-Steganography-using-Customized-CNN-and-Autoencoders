# StegaNet-A-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Image-Steganography-using-Customized-CNN-and-Autoencoders

## Abstract -  
Image steganalysis is a significant area of
research that aims at finding any hidden images or
information within other digital images. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach combining the Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model and an encoder and decoder
network to ensure accurate and efficient image
steganalysis. The proposed method leverages the
discriminative power of CNNs to extract features of
importance from images and then uses the encoderdecoder networks to reconstruct the original image from
the stego or hidden content. Our customized CNN model is
designed to capture the features present in the
steganographic images. The Encoder-Decoder network
plays a crucial role in steganalysis by reconstructing the
original image from the hidden content. By training the
network on a diverse set of steganographic images, it learns
to identify the distinctive artifacts introduced during the
steganographic embedding process. The reconstructed
image is then compared with the original image using
appropriate similarity measures, allowing us to accurately
detect the presence of hidden information. The
combination of the customized CNN model and the
Encoder-Decoder network enables efficient and robust
image steganalysis, making it a valuable tool for digital
forensics and security applications.
